                <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. <br> We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at <br> home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, <br> we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and <br> initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we <br> roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing <br> region.</p>

                <h1>Uncompromising quality</h1>
                <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
